				<p class = "st1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy since the sixteenth century, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book for those points. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the '60s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
